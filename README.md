# Titanic-Dataset-
The given code is for the prediction of the passengers survived in the Titanic Disaster  
As there is lot of missing data is there so in the first part of the code data preprocessing is done so that best predication can be made as the accuracy sevearly gets affected by the missing data . 
In the second part of the code various machine learning algorithim is implemented and the accuracy predicted by each one of the algorithim is compared. We got the maximum acuracy of the 89.88% . 
Machine learning models which had been implemented are : 
DecisionTreeClassifier
AdaBoostClassifier
LogisticRegression
GradientBoostingClassifier
RandomForestClassifier
XGBClassifier
KNeighborsClassifier
VotingClassifier
